# Human vs Machine 

Use these scripts and files to reproduce human vs machine methods and results. <br>

**[1. human_vs_blackbird.xlsx](https://github.com/mswiseman/mildewVision/blob/main/humanvsmachine/human_vs_blackbird.xlsx)** <br>
Data file for our human and blackbird results withe patch and whole leaf disk data. 

**[2. human_tester.py](https://github.com/mswiseman/mildewVision/blob/main/humanvsmachine/human_tester.py)** <br>
Simple GUI that presents a random patch and allows the user to classify it as "clear", "hyphae", or "conidiophore". The program times the user and creates a .csv with the user response and time taken for each patch or image. 

**[3. human_visualizations.py](https://github.com/mswiseman/mildewVision/blob/main/humanvsmachine/human_visualizations.py)** <br>
Various graphs and visualizations with the human data.

**[4. random_image_fr_hdf5.py](https://github.com/mswiseman/mildewVision/blob/main/humanvsmachine/random_image_fr_hdf5.py)** <br>
Use this to create a random patch dataset. 

**[5. test_set](https://github.com/mswiseman/mildewVision/blob/main/humanvsmachine/test_set)** <br>
Directory of patches used to test experts and our best classification and segmentation models.
